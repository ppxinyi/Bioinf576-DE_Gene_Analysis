## Example dataset for using the tool.
This example dataset contains gene expression data for approximately 60,000 genes across 100 HPV integration-positive samples. Each sample is categorized into one of three integration types: type0, type1, and type2. The data is stored in a matrix format, where rows represent genes and columns represent individual samples

This dataset is particularly well-suited for evaluating the functionality of the tool because it captures a wide range of transcriptional responses associated with different HPV integration patterns. The presence of clearly defined groups (type0, type1, type2) allows for robust comparisons, making it an excellent test case for detecting biologically meaningful DE genes, clustering patterns, and subtype-specific gene signatures.
